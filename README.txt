This coding sample is the cognitive Go/NoGo task that I created for an investigational drug study at UIC’s CEDAR Lab. The task presents a series of X and K letters, to which participants are instructed to respond with a button press (“Go”) or withhold their response (“NoGo”). 

To run: Run script “Go_NoGo_Full” and follow instructions in prompt. This will initiate a 10-trial practice task (a 245-trial block is initiated by changing “p” to “t” in the prompt). When the task is complete press spacebar to close.
